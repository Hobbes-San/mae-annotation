It is a lightweight program written in Java, with SQLite database back end.\r\n\r\nCurrently [Keigh Rim](https://github.com/keighrim) is in charge of the maintenance of the project since 2014, along with the companion adjudication tool [MAI](https://github.com/keighrim/mai-adjudication), which will soon be integrated into MAE.\r\n\r\nMAE allows users to define their own annotation tasks, annotate partial words - including discontinuous text spans, use non-consuming tags, easily create links between annotations, and it outputs annotations in stand-off XML.\r\nAlso MAI allows for easy adjudication of extent tags, link tags, and non-consuming tags from any XML standoff annotated documents. (for best results, the files output by MAE should be used).\r\nWhile it does not enforce strict rules for annotation schemes, it is very easy to set up and start running. Check out the wiki for the user guide with detailed instructions.\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\nLatest MAE requires Java 7 to run, and Maven to build. See wiki for more details.\r\n\r\nFor more robust Unicode support, MAE uses [DejaVu Sans](http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page) font as the default. If the annotation task involves lots of Unicode characters, such as Emojis, users are also required to have DejaVu Sans font installed.\r\n\r\n### Download and run\r\n\r\nDownload release package or executable `.jar` from from [releases](https://github.com/keighrim/mae-annotation/releases) page. After you have `mae-<VERSION>.jar` file, simply double click the file will run MAE. Be sure that you have a proper version of Java installed.\r\n\r\n### Annotation\r\n\r\nWe are providing the user guide to MAE using project [Wiki](https://github.com/keighrim/mae-annotation/wiki).\r\n\r\n## License\r\nMAE is a free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nAlso, MAE is written using open source software below.\r\n\r\n#### Open source software used in MAE\r\n\r\n* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) ([apache2](http://www.apache.org/licenses/))\r\n* [Apache common-io](https://commons.apache.org/) ([apache2](http://www.apache.org/licenses/))\r\n* [Xerial sqlite3-JDBC driver](https://bitbucket.org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc) ([apache2](http://www.apache.org/licenses/))\r\n* [LogBack logging framework](http://logback.qos.ch/) ([LGPL 2.1](http://logback.qos.ch/license.html))\r\n* [SLF4J logging framwork](http://www.slf4j.org/) ([MIT](http://www.slf4j.org/license.html))\r\n* [ORMlite](http://ormlite.com/) ([open source license](http://ormlite.com/javadoc/ormlite-core/doc-files/ormlite_9.html#License)) \r\n\r\n## Change History\r\nAll changes are documented on [releases](https://github.com/keighrim/mae-annotation/releases) page.\r\n\r\n### See also\r\n\r\nFor learn more about natural language annotation, please refer to Amber Stubbs and James Pustejovsky's book [Natural Language Annotation for Machine Learning](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920020578.do).
