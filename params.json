(for best results, the files output by MAE should be used).\r\nWhile it does not enforce strict rules for annotation schemes, it is very easy to set up and start running. Check out the wiki for the user guide with detailed instructions.\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\nLatest MAE requires Java 7 to run, and Maven to build. See [the project wiki](https://github.com/keighrim/mae-annotation/wiki) for more details.\r\n\r\nFor robust Unicode support, MAE uses [DejaVu Sans](http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page) font as the default. If the annotation task involves lots of Unicode characters, such as Emojis, users are also recommended to have DejaVu Sans font installed.\r\n\r\n### Download and run\r\n\r\nDownload release package or executable `.jar` from from [releases](https://github.com/keighrim/mae-annotation/releases) page. Once you have `mae-<VERSION>.jar` file, simply double click the file will run MAE. Be sure that you have a proper version of Java installed.\r\n\r\n### Annotation and Adjudication\r\n\r\nSee [the project wiki](https://github.com/keighrim/mae-annotation/wiki) for detailed users' guide.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nMAE is a free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nAlso, MAE is written using open source software below.\r\n\r\n#### Open source software used in MAE\r\n\r\n* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) ([apache2](http://www.apache.org/licenses/))\r\n* [Apache common-io](https://commons.apache.org/) ([apache2](http://www.apache.org/licenses/))\r\n* [Xerial sqlite3-JDBC driver](https://bitbucket.org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc) ([apache2](http://www.apache.org/licenses/))\r\n* [LogBack logging framework](http://logback.qos.ch/) ([LGPL 2.1](http://logback.qos.ch/license.html))\r\n* [SLF4J logging framwork](http://www.slf4j.org/) ([MIT](http://www.slf4j.org/license.html))\r\n* [ORMlite](http://ormlite.com/) ([open source license](http://ormlite.com/javadoc/ormlite-core/doc-files/ormlite_9.html#License)) \r\n\r\n## Change History\r\nAll changes are documented on [releases](https://github.com/keighrim/mae-annotation/releases) page.\r\n\r\n### See also\r\n\r\nTo learn more about natural language annotation, please refer to Amber Stubbs and James Pustejovsky's book [Natural Language Annotation for Machine Learning](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920020578.do).
